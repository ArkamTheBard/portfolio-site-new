            <p id="main-text">
                I am a software developer who is passionate about web development. I have a background in
                computer science and mathematics. I am currently
                working on a project to create a web application and learning how to be more proficient in Python and using the Django framework more.
                <br />
                <br />
                During my time at Field Agent, I fulfilled a dual-role as both an IT Technician and Support Developer where I usually handled projects for
                both their IT operation and development/deployment of internal tools. I also handled a support helpdesk for both all things IT and any bugs or
                issues that came up with their webapp. This included live debugging and writing up bug cards for the development team to take a look at.
                <br />
                <br />
                Having attended both Texas A&M University and the University of Nevada Las Vegas, I have a strong background in computer science. I have worked with a variety of languages and frameworks, including C++, Java, Python, Django, and Angular.
                <br />
                <br />
                Outside of required classes, I worked with Texas Aggie Game Developers during my time at Texas A&M University where we worked together on a passion project to create a 2D Role-Playing Game.
                <br />
                <br />
                I am a graduate from Eastfield College in Mesquite, Texas with an Associates in Science.
                <br />
                <br />
                Prior to working with Field Agent, I worked as a health professional with CVS Pharmacy and then with Northwest Health Systems.
                <br />
                <br />
                I am a graduate of LaunchCode's Full Stack Web Development in Java/Javascript bootcamp as of April 2021.
                <br />
                <br />
                I have also been working on a Discord bot using their Python API and a Discord.js library to create a bot that can be used to play games with friends and manage server permissions.
                <br />
                <br />
                I love the aesthetics of older generation software hence why I decided to use a CSS library that mimicks the look of the old Win9x era. There's something fascinating about seeing old styling like this being used on modern systems.
                <br />
                <br />
                I have many other passions, for example, I am very passionate and interested in learning about moral phiolosophy. Recently I have been reading the <I>Metaphysics of Morals</I> by Emmanuel Kant.
                <br />
                <br />
                Any projects I work on will be on my <a href="https://github.com/ArkamTheBard">github</a> as well as any contributions to any open-source projects I find intersting.
                <br />
